### Key Classes
- `SpeakerEmbeddingExtractor`: Extract speaker embeddings from audio
- `SpeakerManager`: Manage speaker profiles and identification
- `SpeakerAdapter`: Fine-tune models for new speakers
- `VoiceCloningManager`: Create and manage voice models
- `AnimationStyleManager`: Manage animation styles per speaker

## 📋 Verification Results

### ✅ Working Components
1. **All required files present** - All multi-speaker modules exist
2. **Animation styles fully functional** - Tested and working
3. **Speaker adaptation framework** - Complete implementation
4. **Speaker management structure** - Ready for use

### ⚠️ Dependency Issues
- Voice cloning requires `torchaudio` which is not installed
- Speaker embedding extraction needs audio processing libraries
- Can be resolved by installing: `pip install torchaudio`

## 🚀 Usage Examples

### Creating Speaker-Specific Animation Style
```python
from models.animation_styles import AnimationStyleManager

manager = AnimationStyleManager()
style = manager.create_style(
    name="Energetic Presenter",
    description="High-energy presentation style",
    parameters={
        "intensity": 1.2,
        "expressiveness": 0.9,
        "head_movement": 0.8,
        "gesture_frequency": 1.1
    },
    speaker_id="speaker_001"
)
```

### Voice Cloning Workflow
```python
from models.voice_cloning import VoiceCloningManager

voice_manager = VoiceCloningManager(storage_dir="voices")
voice = voice_manager.create_voice(
    audio_path="speaker_samples/",
    speaker_name="John Doe",
    voice_id="john_voice_v1"
)
```

### Speaker Adaptation
```python
from models.speaker_adaptation import SpeakerAdapter

adapter = SpeakerAdapter(model)
adapted_model_path = adapter.adapt_to_speaker(
    audio_dir="speaker_data/",
    speaker_id="new_speaker",
    epochs=10
)
```

## 📊 Implementation Completeness
